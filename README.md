# IV-Curves-in-Partial-Shading
This repository has a python code called "reconstruction.py" that helps to reconstruct I-V curve for every single cell in a large module with many cells during an event of partial shading. This can help to track the health of each individual cell during deployment. Also, one can estimate the energy output during partial shading events.
