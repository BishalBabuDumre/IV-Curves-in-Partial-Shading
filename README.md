# IV-Curves-in-Partial-Shading
This repository has a python code called "reconstruction.py" that helps to reconstruct I-V curve for every single cell in a large module with many cells during an event of partial shading. A relevant CSV file also has been provided. Figure1.jpg shows how individual cell was shaded with the help of a cardboard mask. Shading percent can be changed by varying the shape and size of the mask. This can help to track the health of each individual cell during deployment. Also, one can estimate the energy output during partial shading events.
